# Martoms Vue Components

This is a collection of reusable and customizable Vue 3 components and configurations I use in my project just for reference.

## Frameworks

- Vue
- Nuxt
- Tailwind
- Vueuse

## Features

- **[ProximityScrollNav](./ProximityScrollNav)**: An interactive navigation component with scroll-based animations. Items scale and fade based on their proximity to a central selector, creating a smooth and engaging user experience.
- **[VTyper](./VTyper)**: It simulates a typing effect, displaying an array of strings one by one with configurable typing speed, backspace speed, and loop behavior. It emits updates when text changes and includes a blinking cursor for a dynamic effect.
- **[HorizontalNav](./HorizontalNav)**: A horizontally scrolling navigation component that allows users to cycle through a set of items using left and right arrow buttons. Smooth animations (fly-left and fly-right) enhance transitions between items. The active item is centered while others are hidden. Navigation buttons are disabled at the start and end of the list.
